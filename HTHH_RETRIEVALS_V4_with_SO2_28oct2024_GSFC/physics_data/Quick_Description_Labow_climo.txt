The following is a quick description of this 2017 climatology. This is an updated version of the 2012 
McPeters and Labow climatology with 5 additional years of sonde and MLS data. 
We have merged ozone profile data from 28 years (1988-2016) of ozonesonde measurements
with data from Aura MLS (2004-2016) into monthly 10 degree latitude bands.


OZONE DATA FILES:
Two files now exist for the ozone climatology- one for ozone "hole" conditions and one for climatological profiles outside
the polar vortex (defined by temperatures at 50 hPa). This was done to separate the two regimes for better satellite a-prioris.
The files are identical from 70 South to 90 North and only differ from 90-70 South.

climo.nohole.table
 Contains the ozone mixing ratio table in units of PPMV (parts per million by volume) for conditions outside the polar vortex.

climo.hole.table
  Contains the ozone mixing ratio table in units of PPMV (parts per million by volume).  This is for ozone hole conditions
in the Southern Hemisphere (70-90 South).  The rest of the planet (70 South to 90 North) is the same as climo.nohole.table.

STATISTICS FILES:
 Standard deviations (1 sigma) in PPMV are caluculated for each altitude, month and zone for each of the two regimes.

ALTITUDE SCALE:
The climatological tables are in altitude units of Z* (0-65 km).
 (Z* is in units of km but is actually a pressure scale)

Zstar is defined as:
        Z* = 16 x log(1013/P)
 where P is pressure in hPa
    (and the log is base 10)

LONGITUDINAL TROPICAL VARIATION (wave 1)
tropics.longitude.table
This file contains a monthly climatology of tropical ozone as a function of longitude for 25 South to 25 North.  The data 
comes from the ozone sonde stations normalized to the OMI-MLS tropospheric residual. It covers the altitude range of 
0-19km in five degree longitude increments.
